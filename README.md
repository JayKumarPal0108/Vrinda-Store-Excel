Step No 1 
#Data Cleaning 

Data cleaning means checking your data if you have any null values, outliers and if so converting your data in homogenous columns and deleteing the duplicate and null values. 

Used Filter to check what type of data we have in s[pecific columns 
	

In the gender column we have same gender denoted with different verbiages so we corrected them by using find and replace 

In the Qty column we find that the quantity is mentioned in words, replaced them with numeric values.
